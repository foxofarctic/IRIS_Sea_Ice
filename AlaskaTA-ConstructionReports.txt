Hi Kasey,

These don’t appear to be in any order. They are mostly TA Alaska, but some N4 stations might have slipped in. Also, many have corrections sent later and both versions are included.

> Comments:
>
> Drilling was difficult due to small cobbles jamming up the casing. At 2340 UTC we took off the first casing due to dents and replaced it with a new one. We also replaced the ring bit for good measure in the hopes that it would help expedite drilling. 0000 UTC we abandoned our borehole and moved the drill rig over approximately three feet to begin a new borehole. After moving the drill we were able to complete drilling by 0241 UTC.

> Drilled the borehole to 77" with the solid stem auger and met refusal.  It was late in the evening and the a large storm system had moved in with heavy rain and winds.  We left for the evening and returned the next morning and switched to hammer.  Advanced the hammer through collapsed and saturated soils to the rock.  Let the air blow out the saturated material and began hammering to TD.  The station is located with 15' of 80'+ tall trees.  Limbs from many of these trees were falling on and around the station components during construction in the storm.   GPS and cell station mounts are located inside the cooler to preserve them from removal or damage via debris strike.

> Comments: The permafrost posed specific drilling challenges. The bit would bite in and immediately gum up with frozen clay; it was too sticky to be augered up the drill flights. Every 4-6 inches of depth we would have to extract the auger flights and peel the frozen clay off the bit. From about 6'-9', the auger actually drilled as meant to, and extracted frozen material upwards. The thought is that within the active layer near the surface, the ice/soil behaves differently due to seasonal freeze/thaw. Once we were in true permafrost, it chipped up easier and augered upwards. All in all, the drilling only took 2.5 hours.
>  There was a wildfire actively burning about 5 miles south of the site. However, in two weeks of monitoring prior to installation, the fire had not advanced in the direction of the site. It was still across a large river when we finished and the winds were weak and favorable for us.

> Four pieces of PVC casing were inserted into the borehole and the top piece was cut off at ~ 12 inches above the ground. Pumped "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout from the surface through a plug in the bottom of the PVC casing.  A check valve in the plug kept grout on the outside of the PVC. Three 50 lb bags were pumped until grout was visible from surface; measured ~ 75” below TOC; estimate 113 inches of grout in the borehole annulus.  As we pulled out the grout pipe, the grout remaining inside the pipe was allowed to fill the bottom of the casing and cover the protrusions on the top of the plug, ~ 3 in. The remaining grout was poured around the borehole at the surface.

> Comments: We left Delta in the morning and drove to where the drill had been left overnight. We removed the DTH tooling and rotation head and installed the auger rotation head.  We loaded the drill onto the flatbed and continued on to L26K, located about 28 miles south of Tok. We met the landowner and his huge dog around 12:30, setup the drill and started auguring at about 13:20.  Once we started drilling, progress was steady and there no notable events.  It took about 40 min to auger the borehole. At the bottom of the hole we encountered a layer of cobbles that we could not penetrate. Further, as the cobbles were transported uphole by the auger, they reamed out sections at the top of the borehole to 10-12 inches in diameter.  Consequently though we had augured 16 ft, when we pulled out we lost part of the borehole, it caved in to a final TD of 14.5 ft.

The grout pipe was threaded onto the valve assembly too tight, so there was some grout spillage during the process of removing the pipe and the grout plug breached allowing about 1 inch of of extra grout into the bottom. This extra grout set up overnight and was not a factor in placing the sensor.

> Comments: 
> The site is a sited on NPS land in the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve on the north side of Coal Creek mining camp at the old water tank location.  The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from J26L via helicopter sling load and then on to Central airstrip upon completion.  The hut is east of the casing.   Well-cap was surrounded with a timber windwall and completely buried in sod as was the conduit.
> The pre-existing borehole from the earlier attempted site construction was reoccupied and drilled after shoveling the top two feet of heaved soil out of the way.  The casing was advanced to total depth with 7 inches of stick up to avoid surface water issues in the well-cap box or casing.  The hut was already in place upon arrival and is in a local low spot at the site and may have sporadic water issues.  Drain holes were added in the floor and bottom flange.  Site installation occurred synchronous with construction.

There was no annulus outside the casing, so I feel confident that we filled all void space beneath the plug with grout.

> Notes: Drilling went fast today, approximately 1.5 hours. In the last 2 feet of the hole we hit water. After the hammer was pulled and the drill taken away from the site the water depth was resting 23" from the bottom of the hole. After 10 minutes the water depth had not changed. We installed the grout plug and waited to see if there was any further water recharge in the hole, there was none. Once we grouted the hole we removed all of the excess water except for a 1/4 inch resting on top of the grout plug. We waited for another 15 minutes to make sure there was no recharge in the hole, which there was none, and continued with our standard sensor installation procedures.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through what appears to be a seasonally frozen layer and into poorly consolidated, saturated soil.  The borehole was open hole hammered with the ring bit in place.  When the A-star lifted the drill rig out of the way the PVC casing was placed into the borehole, but some material had collapsed, so total drilled depth was not achieved with the casing.  The site is in a bog with seasonally high water in the spring and early summer so the casing stick-up was left slightly higher than normal.  Additionally the hut was flown in with a pallet attached to lift the hut off of the saturated tussocks.  The well cap did not have the hardware with it so the lid was secured with two ratchet straps until the team can return during the deployment and affix screws and add additional dry grout at the surface.

> Notes: The borehole was open hole hammered through soil and into permafrost.  After completing the hole, the drill rig was removed with the A-Star, but ~6" of borehole sloughed in during that time.  ONce the casing was placed at total depth and allowed to settle it began to freeze in place while we added 3 gallons of thick mixed grout.  No jacking was observed due to the refreezing of the soil around the casing.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the PVC cap.  No usable soil was in the area so tussocks were used for the wind deflector and to bury the conduit and LB.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through fractured and platy rock.  The drilling went quickly (15 minutes), fracturing each plate and blowing the cuttings horizontally within the strata.  5 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole, but was dissipating quickly into the strata.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  Several burned trees (standing dead) were pushed over or cut down to create a safe LZ for the helicopters.  Only enough room for one helicopter at the site.  Drilling was finished when the hut arrived so the sling was moved directly to the drill, which was forwarded to G29M.

> Comments: 
> The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from N19K using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The hut was brought in on the second lift load from Port Alsworth.  Drilling advanced quickly but when attempting to trip the hammer out of the casing; fine, tightly packed cutting packed behind the lip of the hammer and seized in the casing.  Several attempt to free it by actuating the hammer and rotating the head were unsuccessful.  Finally utilized metal rods to hold the casing down while pulling the hammer up and the crew cleared fines with the small compressed air clean-out tool and shook the hammer and mast.  Hut panels aligned to roughly 180º.

> At the end of drilling we dropped the ring bit and left the steel casing in the borehole. To plug the bottom of the casing, we used a variation of the 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve.  In this variation, the o-ring groove had been deepened following experience using it at Pinon Flat. Grouted with pure Portland cement.  The first time we tried pumping grout, the grout leaked past the o-ring and came up the sides of the plate.  So we pulled it up, checked the o-ring, put it back in the borehole and reset the plate in the shoe.  Re-measured the setting depth and resumed pumping grout. Again, the o-ring did not seal and grout leaked past it into the borehole.  At this point we stopped pumping grout and removed the grout pipe from hole, leaving behind several inches of grout atop the plate.

> Comments: 
> We used an AStar B3 helicopter to sling the drill and a cargo net with the compressor, tools and other supplies to the site. The borehole was drilled with downhole hammer tooling, leaving open the channels through the bit face (no Delrin blocks), and using 200 ft of layflat hose connected to the Vanair compressor. Drilling time required to reach total depth was 50 min.  The drilling went relatively smoothly, with the only problems being the hammer intermittently clogging with soil and shutting down during drilling of the first 4 ft of hole. When the hammer stopped, we were able to pull it up and clear the blockage with a blast of air, enabling the hammer to restart so we could resume drilling.  We did this several times.  After we reached the depth with competent rock, the hammer functioned as designed.  It was interesting to note that the CFM produced by the Vanair compressor  was sufficient to carry rock chips with a long dimension up to 1/2” through the hammer annulus to the surface.
>
> Recommendations:
> 1. Go back to the original size o-ring groove, or use a fatter o-ring.  
> 2. Check the inside dimension of the shoe for variation from the original specification.

> PVC was placed in the borehole after drilling, leveled and secured in place with duckbill anchors and grout bags over the top.  Grout was poured into the surrounding annulus from the bottom to the surface.  Initially, not enough resistance was on the casing to resist the buoyancy of the air filled casing and it began to jack out of the grout filled borehole.  The casing was placed back to full depth, secured and the grout was allowed to cure before removing the weight and anchors. Portland grout surrounds the PVC casing and is poured to level with grade at the surface.

> The station is located ~100 yards, south-southeast of a repeater tower on a large hill east of the main road.  The borehole was drilling with a cased downhole hammer, then the hammer and casing were removed and a PVC casing was placed in the borehole.  The borehole is north of the station enclosure.  The area in front of the CAC hut had several small deciduous trees which were removed to aide in solar charging.  16 AGM batteries (main) and 6 air cell batteries (primary) are power storage at the station.  The road to the site was frozen and firm in the morning when the field team arrived, but at departure large sections had thawed and the access road was muddy and slippery for the vehicles during descent.  Site visits should be made in dry conditions.

> Notes: This borehole was open hole hammered in sand and silt.  The hammer, minus the casing, but with a ring bit down to total depth.  The hammer was tripped out and placed back in the hole several times to clear material.  The PVC casing was then inserted into the hole and anchored to the ground with a casing clamp and duck bill anchors.  The grout was then poured around the external annulus slowly to allow the grout to reach full depth, and poured to within 18" of the surface.  Surface soils were placed over the portland to grade.  The duck bill anchor will be cut tomorrow to remove any potential from additional noise from the anchor in the active layer.  Station is located just under four miles from the Bethel airport with the town visible from the station.  Reflectors were placed on the hut as snow machine traffic is possible during the winter.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through soil and permafrost.  The drilling took 27 minutes to complete.  2 gallons of grout were poured into the borehole to counteract heaving and the grout plug was hammered into place allowing 2.5" of grout to get forced to the top of the plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug/grout and leveled.  This station is located on a small hill adjacent to the Stokes Point DEW Line station (500m north).  There is a generator and towers at Stokes Point which may be noise sources.  A grizzly bear was on a kill 5 miles from the station, so wildlife damage may also occur.

> Notes: The blue drill rig blew a compressor hose, we attempted an onsite repair and in turn blew through two more hose patches. In the end we had to call it quits until we could get parts sent out to Unakleet. Once we had the parts the next day we were able to fix the blue drill so that we could finish the hole. We had four shutdowns due to overheating after the fix but were able to push through.

A grout pipe was left holding the grout plug in place with a grout pipe clamp, which was anchored to the ground, just in case of frost jacking. A 5 gallon bucket was secured over the casing to avoid water and snow accumulation inside the casing.

> Comments: 
> The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from Ninilchik using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The borehole is placed between the hut and the short drill-braced GPS monument.  The hammer quit cycling after 3 feet.  Tripped the hammer and casing out of the borehole, removed the casing and cleaned out the hammer to allow for travel.  Continued drilling the same location.  Borehole blew out around casing, resulting in cuttings piling up around the external portion of the casing and falling back into the borehole.  Compressor motor was shutting down regularly with as little as 6 minutes of run time and up to 60 minutes of downtime.  Crew used snow at the site to cool the oil filter and additionally placed snow on the compressor side near the temperature sensor to allow for longer duration drilling.  Hammered until we ran out of fuel.  Cut off additional stick-up from the 104" casing.  ~12" cut off.

> Rim to Bottom of casing: 19ft 5in
> Rim to grade level: 15in
> Grouting Method: Mixed ~4gal of pure portland cement at the surface and then dumped it into the borehole, ~1x94lb bag portland cement.  Assembled 4 sections of 6in ID PVC casing, with plug installed in bottom piece. Pushed PVC casing into borehole and displaced cement to the bottom of the hole; had to overcome hydrostatic pressure to get the casing down. Wrapped plastic around the top 4 ft of casing in the ground. Put temporary cap on PVC, set anchors and tie-down wires to keep the PVC in place.  Left PVC cap and tie-down wires in place while cement cured.

This site is approximately 0.4 miles from the originally proposed location, but still within the state permit boundaries.  The original point was in heavy fog for the duration of construction and installation.

A ball valve assembly was attached to the bottom of the grout pipe and affixed with a paracord line. The grout pipe was threaded onto the valve assembly too tight, so there was some grout spillage during the process of removing the pipe and the grout plug breached allowing about 1 inch of of extra grout into the bottom. This extra grout set up overnight and was not a factor in placing the sensor.

> Notes:  Silver drill began to leak hydraulic fluid, we assume that a fitting has gone bad. While grouting the borehole a vacuum was created and the grout was slowing being sucked past the grout plug. We believe this may have been due to the volcanic material we were drilling through, mainly pumice.

> Notes: This site was challenging and took 5 attempts before succeeding on the six hole. E25K consisted of back fill material from the airstrip next to the site. The loose gravel kept clogging the casing and each time we pulled the hammer and casing out of the hole the hole would collapse. On our six and final attempt we were able to drill into an area that was approximately 90% top soil and 10% gravel.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through fractured bedrock and into competent bedrock.   The fractured rock was angular and initially deflecting the hammer and casing out of level.  Once it was seated the drilling progressed quickly until the bedrock was reached.  The bedrock was very hard and hammer and carbides showed signs of wear from the last 30" of drilling.  The well cap was surrounded with a rock wind wall and the conduit was buried with rock as well.  Rain fell throughout the construction.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered through poorly consolidated rock with the last couple of feet being competent rock. Hammering began at 0959 and ended at 1129 (local time) for 1 hr 30 min total minutes drilling. The blue rig had two overheats but otherwise drilling was uneventful.  This initial location selected for the site was in the valley and in a sun shadow on arrival.  The site sat low in the valley surronded by high peaks to the east and south, with lesser peaks still to the west.  A recently active rockfall was above the permitted station location.  Contacted Molly Staats and Max Enders for alternate locations that would be better solar and comms options, visited the two options and selected the most feasible for construction and installation.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through sandy soils and heavily weathered rock, which was surprising based on the surface boulders on the surface surrounding the area.   The drilling took 30 minutes to complete.  2 gallons of grout were pumped to refusal.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug/grout and leveled.  The station is located on a low, boulder-covered ridge north of the Barrier River on Gwitchin Tribal Council land. We had a Gwitchin environmental observer, Andrew, on site for construction and installation.

> Rim to Bottom of casing: 103.255
> Rim to grade level: 6.5 in
>
> Grouting Method: 
> At the end of drilling the ring bit was dropped and steel casing left in the borehole.  The 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve was used to plug the bottom of the casing.  The plate seats in the casing shoe and locks to the side of the shoe with pins to hold it in place while an o-ring provides a positive seal.  Grouted using "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout. We started pumping grout but the hole would not take any and back pressure blew out the check-valve below the funnel.  We took apart the hoses and pipes and determined that the blockage was in the downhole check valve.  Went in with a tool to clear the blockage, reassembled pipes and hoses and resumed grouting. We pumped about 3/4 gal of grout into the borehole before refusal. When we pulled out the grout pipe the grout remaining inside was allowed to fill the bottom of the casing and cover the protrusions on the top of the plate. The remaining grout was poured into the borehole around the casing, at the surface.

> We started drilling this borehole with the auger but hit large rocks and cobbles at about 6 ft bgl and decided to switch to the downhole hammer.  We ran the hammer without Delrin blocks, using 100 ft of air hose and it performed well to total depth. It took a total of 75 minutes to drill the borehole, including 40 minutes to swap the tooling.

> Comments: Met with abutting landowner/caretaker; John Bowman. Moved drill rig into position. Anchored drill rig with "duck-bills". Augured through fine grained silts/clays. Reached water table at approximately 12 feet below grade. Augured 8 inch hole to the limit of auger flights and drill travel, approximately 18 feet. Re-augured hole to remove remaining muck. Pre-assembled four, five foot sections of threaded PVC borehole casing, 6 inch inside diameter. Tested fit of casing in borehole. Removed casing and added Portland cement grout to bottom of augured hole. Used base of drill motor mount to stabilize PVC casing in borehole. Anchored PVC casing plumb with two cable pulls(come-a-longs) and removed excess soil, graded surface surrounding casing.
>      Returned on 13 November checked plumb and depth of borehole casing to bottom of casing plug. Installed threaded cap on casing. Measured threaded cap height above grade. Marked exposed PVC casing with orange surveyor flagging tape. Cleaned up trash at site

> The station is located adjacent to the east side of the crew quarters and kitchen on the Yukon DOT yard.  The borehole is approximately 13 feet from the building and from a satellite dish.  A septic holding tank is approximately 15 feet to the north.  The borehole was drilled with a cased downhole hammer, as the unconsolidated gravels were collapsing and could not be augered and the borehole remain open.  The borehole is north-east of the station enclosure.

> Notes:  The station sits on a bedrock outcrop with fractured bedrock on the surface south of Mt. Upton and above several large glaciers and the ice sheet below Mount Logan.  High wind exposure is expected at the station as well as large amounts of snow.  Avalanches and rock slides were occurring in the vicinity throughout the day.   The borehole went through the first 6' of cobbles and ice with some effort.  The ice was shattering and melting during drilling which created a lot of muddy debris in the casing but was clearing.  When the borehole transitioned to bedrock the drilling slowed considerably which turned out to benefit the drilling because it gave the caked mud time to dry and expel rather than packing the casing.  The weather began to deteriorate throughout the day and helicopter circumstances outside of our control caused us to have to pull off during the first day without completing the station.  There is no soil at the station location so the well cap has a wind wall built around the cap and casing.  The hut could not be anchored with stakes or rock bolts in the fractured and loose surface conditions.  Several hundred pounds of additional rocks were piled on the hut flanges and around the hut wall to aid in anchoring.   On day two, the anchoring was completed.

Several blue drill rig "overheats" occurred, delaying the completion of drilling.  When the rig was operating the drilling progressed quickly.  Approximately 2 gallons of grout filled the void beneath the grout plug and around the casing in the bed rock.  The hut was added on 06/18/2017.

> Notes: This borehole was open hole hammered in permafrost.  The hammer, minus the casing, but with a ring bit down to total depth.  The borehole stayed open without any collapse due to the solid permafrost walls.  The PVC casing was then inserted into the hole and anchored to the ground with a casing clamp and rebar.  The grout was then poured around the external annulus slowly to allow the grout to reach full depth, and poured to the surface.  Surface vegetation was placed over the portland to grade.  The station is located just east of Dall Lake.  Reflectors were placed on the hut as snow machine traffic is possible during the winter.  In part due to the nature of the consistent permafrost walls of the boring and the cuttings sealing off above it, the rig over-pressured the borehole.  Enough pressure that the rig lifted off of the ground and began to rotate slightly.  Jeff was able to shut the rig down before any damage or injuries occurred and the over-pressure blew out at the surface.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth primarily through coarse gravel fill and native gravel and cobbles.  The drilling took 36 minutes to complete and the ring bit dropped without trouble.  2 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole, with roughly 1" spilling from the grout pipe on top of the aluminum grout plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  This station is located in a gravel borrow pit that during construction had a loader operating continually and a dump truck driving in and out.  Anticipate seasonal noise peaks during the summer from construction activities.  A large berm of boulders and gravel was built in a semi-circle around the hut and the borehole to protect it from construction and recreational traffic.

A rigid plug of grout formed in the pipe just above the disc. A second batch was mixed thinner, and pumped in, but we had similar high pressure/low volume injection. When the pipe was removed a portion of grout drained into the bottom. A long pipe with narrow poker was used to probe the flapper to ensure that all remaining void space beneath the disc filled with grout. The result is that the space is not pressurized. Grout was poured down the annulus to the surface.

This compressor provided a sufficient airflow to drill the hole but we still want to try running the DTH with a smaller compressor.

> The Delrin inserts we use to limit the size of cuttings getting into the hammer annulus were not in place when we started drilling and the DTH got plugged up with soil and small rocks.  Eventually it stopped hammering and we had to pull it out of the hole to clean out the blockage.  After clearing the blockage, we put in the Delrin blocks and ran the DTH back in the hole to continued drilling.  The drilling from this point went smoothly to TD.  All together it took about 30 min to drill this borehole, including the time needed to clear the DTH blockage.  After the drilling was finished, we used the knuckle boom to pick up the drill by the recently welded-on helicopter attachment loop.  The balance of the drill while hanging looked good.

The borehole was advanced until we ran out of fuel and cut off additional stick-up from the 104" casing.  ~19" cut off.   Roughly 4 hours of drill time to complete this borehole.  The ATA CAC hut is directly adjacent to the AVO hut and is anchored in place with surface stones piled around the perimeter of the hut and on the flanges.

> The site is a sited on state land northeast of Pogo Mine at the head of the Charley River watershed.  The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from J25K via helicopter sling load and returned to Delta Junction air strip.  The hut is east of the casing.  One large bore grizzly was near the intended location upon arrival and moved off when the helicopter circled for a short time.  Well-cap was surrounded with a rock windwall and completely buried in sod as was the conduit.

> Notes: This was a challenging site. We drilled our first hole to a depth of 58" and pulled the casing to find there was wear on the carbide teeth on the hammer. We had to leave the site due to weather and came back a few days later. To prevent further wear and tear on the hammer we decided to move the drill rig. After drilling 16 inches we pulled the casing and found the same wear on the new ring bit we were using. After some consultation it was decided to go back to the original hole and drill down to where we abandoned the hole. We successfully drilled back down to depth and cut the casing off 6.5" above the surface.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered through competent rock from the surface to TD.  Drilling was delayed in the morning due to a short in the blue drill electrical system that had to be located and fixed.  Hammering began at 1138 and ended at 1520 (local time) for 3 hr 42 min total minutes drilling. The blue rig had one overheat but otherwise drilling was uneventful but slow in hard rock.  Due to the duration of drilling the blue drill consumed it's fuel and the bore hole was terminated shallow of the normal TD.  When the construction and installation team initially arrived on site they began clearing burned and standing dead vegetation from the station location and cleared an LZ large enough for a single helicopter to land near the site.  The second helicopter was still landing about 600' away.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through organic duff and into silty permafrost.   The drilling took 62 minutes to complete.  Dry grout was added to saturated silt and the grout plug was hammered into position.  Additional grout was added over the grout plug to absorb and seal off the plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug/grout and leveled.  The station is located just above a small creek.  The initial LZ is at the creek with the helicopter tail hanging over the creek.  Several dead snags were removed near the station location to allow for solar charging and a small helicopter LZ near the station.

> Comments: 
> The site is on a private property inholding in Wrangell - St. Elias National Park and Preserve owned by Kirk Ellis.  The site is located on the NW end of the private small aircraft runway.  Although unexpected, the landowner will notify IRIS AOC staff if any sustained heavy equipment activity or other potentially disturbing activity will be occurring in the area.  The Lundrill V1 was driven to the site using the Earthscope crane truck.  The hut is west of the casing and both are located behind a debris pile and a burn barrel.  The Gen 2 rig had the main mast pin partially fail during drilling.  The bolt which held the pin, securing the mast to the frame, deformed during normal drilling operations and the mast began to rotate out of position from the frame.  Due to this failure occurring while the hammer was already halfway into the ground it reduced the severity of the failure and the mast was repositioned and the pin was replaced with a new bolt.

> At the end of drilling we dropped the ring bit and left the steel casing in the borehole. To plug the bottom of the casing, we used a variation of the 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve.  In this variation, the o-ring groove had been deepened following experience using it at Pinon Flat. Grouted with pure Portland cement.  The first time we tried pumping grout, the grout leaked past the o-ring and came up the sides of the plate.  So we pulled up the plate, re-measured the setting depth, gave it some encouragement with a steel rod and hammer, confirmed that the plate was in the correct position downhole and then resumed pumping grout. On this second try the o-ring appeared to be sealing so we continued to pump grout until the hopper was empty.  Measured the depth when we stopped pumping and discovered that the o-ring had in fact leaked and grout was coming into the casing. At this point we stopped pumping grout and removed the grout pipe from hole, leaving ~15 inches of grout atop the plate.

> Comments: 
> The borehole was drilled with downhole hammer tooling, leaving open the channels through the bit face (no Delrin blocks), and using 200 ft of layflat hose connected to the Vanair compressor. Drilling time required to reach total depth was 25 min. The drilling went very smoothly all the way to TD.  In the top part of the hole, we were required to regularly pull up and clear the bit with a blast of air but this has become a normal procedure.  As we were getting setup to grout, Carl Tape from UA showed up with a reporter and video person.   Brian proceeded to give them an interview describing the purpose of our work there, what we were doing and the different components that would comprise the final station.

The DOT parcel K is surrounded by trees and vegetation.  We utilized the spare casing to create a bollard on which sits the 2" pipe for the VSAT dish.  This will have the VSAT dish 12' off of the ground and able to clear the vegetation.  There is a lot of debris and derelict vehicles surrounding the site.

> Notes: Station is located on First Nations Settlement Land, adjacent to a NWTel in-holding.  Coordinated the installation with the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Governmentrepresentatives; Kay Linley and James Roberts.  James had planned to meet the team sometime during construction and installation, but did not show up as arranged.  The surface bedrock was heavily fractured but hard.  After ~3 feet the bedrock yielded to a crushed gravel and drilled easily.  The borehole swallowed 9 gallons of grout before pressurizing.  The approved install location may be placed directly on a surface fault.  A NWTel tower and generator building are ~100m from the station location.

> Notes: Drilling was challenging at this site due to the nature of the rock.  The rock was highly friable and would pack the casing more rabidly than the cuttings could clear, regardless of the speed of drilling.  Patient drilling allowed the boring to get to full depth.  ~2 gallons were pumped through the grout plate and 2.5 gallons pumped through around the outer diameter of the well casing from the surface.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through fractured/weathered rock into competent, hard bedrock.   Drilling progressed relatively quickly through the fractured rock, taking 38 minutes, and then an additional 43 minutes in the competent bedrock.  The wind wall and conduit burial was with soil and rocks from the site.  Some caribou antlers were placed around the well cap.  No additional site clearing was necessary.  Grout was pumped until increased back pressure caused the grout pipe to deflect slightly.  Approximately 3 gallons of grout filled the void beneath the grout plug and around the casing in the bed rock.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth primarily through coarse gravel fill and native gravel and cobbles.  The drilling took 36 minutes to complete and the ring bit dropped without trouble.  2 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole, with roughly 1" spilling from the grout pipe on top of the aluminum grout plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  This station is located in a gravel borrow pit that during construction had a loader operating continually and a dump truck driving in and out.  Anticipate seasonal noise peaks during the summer from construction activities.  A large berm of boulders and gravel was built in a semi-circle around the hut and the borehole to protect it from construction and recreational traffic.

>  The grout pipe was screwed into the steel disc and secured in place with the grout pipe clamp on the casing rim. We had difficulty injecting all grout down the pipe- not sure if this is due to the rubber flapper valve being too tight or grout being too viscous. A rigid plug of grout formed in the pipe just above the disc. A second batch was mixed thinner, and pumped in, but we had similar high pressure/low volume injection. When the pipe was removed a portion of grout drained into the bottom. A long pipe with narrow poker was used to probe the flapper to ensure that all remaining void space beneath the disc filled with grout. The result is that the space is not pressurized. Grout was poured down the annulus to the surface.

> Comments: Mobilized drill, 6x6 ATV and equipment to Middleton Island the day before using Skyvan and Navajo.  Used ATV to trailer drill to site and winch to move drill into final position. Drilled borehole using auger and rock bit.  Encountered water bearing gravel/cobble layer at ~5ft that collapsed into borehole when we removed the auger, filling the bottom 3 ft of borehole. To try sealing off this zone, we cleaned out hole as much as possible then ran in hole with fishtail bit and added 50# of bentonite chips (Halliburton Hole Plug) and 50# of bentonite granules. Re-drilled to TD in bedrock and rotated the bentonite mixture for ~ 1hr.  Pulled out of hole and measured depth, still lost bottom part of hole. Ran back in hole to clean out, pulled out and installed PVC.  Subsequently drilled borehole for GPS monument.

> Grouting Method: Prior to grouting, we pulled the steel casing out of the borehole and replaced it with two pieces of 6 in ID schedule 40 PVC screwed together with a grout-through cap on the bottom. We grouted using the prototype grout pump and "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout. After pumping for only a few minutes, the pump plugged and we could not clear it.  We unscrewed the surface lines and did not find any blockage. So we pulled the casing and grout pipe out of the hole to look for a plug and found organics blocking the check valve.  Grout was not screened before pumping into hole.  Removed threaded cap with plugged check valve and replaced with a new cap and check valve assembly.  Put casing back in hole and resumed pumping grout, screened this time.  The grout now pumped smoothly and we continued until it returned to the surface; approximately 1 55# bag pumped.

> Comments: Very difficult access to drilling location.  Had to winch drill about 70m up a slope and another 20m over rocky ground to reach the site (1.5 hrs). It was not possible to stage the compressor close to the drill so we had to run 2 x 100 ft of hose over the cliff face to reach the compressor that was located down in the quarry.  Once we started drilling, progress was steady and there no notable events other than a couple of fractures, one with water.  All together the drilling took ~66 min.
>
> Bob Busby arrived soon after the drill reached the drilling location and assisted with the final stages of setting up the drill and stringing the compressor hose. Members of the Installation team also arrived later in the day and began trenching from the AEC hut to the borehole.  Winching the drill back down the steep slope was as difficult as it was to get it up to the drill site.  After we got the drill safely to the bottom (1.75 hrs) we quit for the day; came back and picked it up the following morning and headed to Tok.

> Drilling at the site was difficult.  The weathered bed rock was very rotten and came apart very easily under the hammer causing the casing to partially pack.  Once into bedrock the drilling went better to TD and the ring bit was dropped.    Borehole placed in west of existing AVO hut closer to the preferred LZ at the station.  Assisted AVO personnel with battery swap and system upgrade. Heavy fog and rain for most of the day during construction.

> Notes:  The station sits on top of a broad bedrock mountain above the Nakina River and Nakina Lake.  The location is ~22' from the location from the reconnaissance report and permit.  The original location was on slanting bedrock which is very difficult for the Darkside Giraffe drill.  The Drill and compressor had been flown to a subordinate peak two days prior but worsening weather caused the team to pull off of the mountain.  The equipment stayed at the subordinate peak another day as a weather day was called with no flights.  There is little soil at the station location so the well cap has a wind wall built around the cap and casing with cobbles.  The hut is anchored with stakes on the hut flange. The bedrock drilled easily and appeared to be mainly composed of serpentenite rocks.  The site is very windy and the plateau is wind scoured.  The cloud ceiling during construction was 50-100' above the station for the duration of the day.

> The original location selected during the recon phase was not feasible given the limitations of the crane truck and the terrain around the private property.  The field crew located an alternate install location on city land near the fuel tank farm.  After coordinating with the mayor of Pelican and the IRIS permitting specialist (Molly), the new permit was signed and drilling and construction activities began.  The station sits up a slope from the village of Pelican.  The tank farm is south of the borehole by ~75', with a shipping container ~25' south and box pallets located within ~10'.  No wind barrier was constructed during this visit and is planned during a follow-up visit to install communications in early October and to demob the truck and rig.

> Portland cement was mixed in a very viscous paste and shoveled downhole, followed by the remainder of the bucket of dry cement mix. There was a lot of standing water downhole. We no longer had a grout pipe after our deployment, so a grout plug was not feasible. There was concern about heaving material at the bottom of the hole during the time until someone returns to install a new sensor, hence the straight cement mix downhole.

> There was standing water at a depth of 78" soon before the hole was covered with a bucket. It would be prudent to bring a pump, a K-packer, and more cement when the installation occurs. The water table was recharging pretty quickly and it's not guaranteed that the bucket of cement dumped downhole will do anything to seal the bottom.

> Comments: 
> The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from Delta Junction using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The compressor overheated 3 times during the day while drilling in the brush.  As the day progressed wind and rain moved in as well as dense smoke from the nearby wildfires.  S. Dalton and J. Miner rerouted antenna cable and moved Yagi to the top of the tower.   Power and comms cable from the AEC vault were secured to the building and a new gasket porthole passthrough.  The power cable had abraded and exposed the ground upon arrival and had shorted out the system. The borehole was advanced to total depth but the rig ran out of fuel nearly simultaneously and the hydraulics seemed unable to pull up the chain.  Departed the site for the day due to very poor weather and visibility.  Returned the following day with additional fuel.  Rig could still not pull the casing.  After extensive trouble shooting found that the top chain sprocket on the mast had not been welded to the mast and was slipping down onto the mast.  After the bolt for the sprocket tab failed the sprocket slid down and bit into the mast, thus jamming the mast.  Field team removed the chain and utilized a grinder to remove a 1" tab of mast material to free up the sprocket.  Then hammered the mast head up to roughly 1/4 of an inch from the original location.  Drilled through the head and the mast and secured it with a through bolt.  Then were able to pull the hammer from the mast and move on to installation.

Using the new grout assembly pipe (metal, not PVC) we forced the downhole plug into the seating position inside the shoe.  Using the locking mechanism we secured the grout pipe in place and mixed and pumped grout (pure portland cement) through the grout pipe.  There was no leakage inside the casing and the aluminum plug sat flush in the bottom of the casing.  Pumped grout until back pressure was equivalent to what we could push with the new grout pump assembly (estimated 200 PSI), then left the grout pipe inside the casing to hold the plug in place while the grout cured overnight.

> The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The hut was brought in on the second lift load.  Drilling initially was problematic.  After ~3 hours of drilling the crew tripped out the casing and hammer from 1.5 feet down.  Removed the casing and found the hammer was packed with fine, hard packed mud (most likely from the the previous install at O19K).  Hammer was cleaned, and a new borehole was started.  Hammer was steadily advancing until the fuel ran out at the TD reported.  Hut panels oriented 178º.

> The borehole was initially advanced open hole down to TD.  The borehole would not allow for a casing to be placed due to slight wander of the hammer and ring bit during drilling.  The hammer was advanced again with the casing on and advanced to TD.  The hut was already in place upon arrival and the batteries were at 13.2 V upon arrival.  Site installation occurred synchronous with construction.

> Notes:  Cleared trees and shrubs around the GPS station and for the hut installation occurred before the rig and compressor arrived.  The Darkside drilling rig sits on tall legs with skids on the ground and looks very similar to an aluminum giraffe.  Drilling was a bit problematic on the glacial outwash, with the fines packing up the casing occasionally.  Eventually we were able to get the borehole finished and the grouting completed.  Mike Schmidt arrived later in the afternoon and worked on the battery swap for the UAF GPS battery swap.  Weather was poor in the morning but improved while we readied the hut and drill rig.  Once on site the weather continued clearing and the temperature increased and winds increased throughout the day as well.  The CAC hut is west of the GPS solar tower by 12'.

When attempting to disconnect the grout pipe from the grout plug the plug was dislodged. We were able to put another grout plug in place within a matter of minutes and were able to secure the plug into place. We poured approximately three inches of grout on top the plug to ensure that there would be a proper seal and platform for the sensor to sit on.

> Notes: Station is located southwest of the NWT border with the Yukon, adjacent to an existing meteorological station.   The surface was a combination of fine silts and vegetation.  Fine materials packed in around the ring bit which proved difficult to drop.  Approximately 30 minutes to drop the ring bit.  The met station is ~120m from the seismic station.  Dempster highway is ~350m east.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through what seemed to be layered rock alternating between fractured/weathered rock into competent, bedrock.   Drilling progressed quickly to total depth with small changes in advancement rates depending on rock type.  Grout was pumped until increased back pressure caused the grout pipe to deflect slightly.  Approximately 2.5 gallons of grout filled the void beneath the grout plug and around the casing in the bed rock.  The threaded nipple beneath the ball valve on the grout pipe unthreaded and remained in the borehole attached to the grout plate.  An additional liter of sand was added to make sure there was sufficient sand over the nipple to not impact the sensor leveling.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through fractured and platy rock.  The drilling went quickly (15 minutes), fracturing each plate and blowing the cuttings horizontally within the strata.  5 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole, but was dissipating quickly into the strata.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  Several burned trees (standing dead) were pushed over or cut down to create a safe LZ for the helicopters.  Only enough room for one helicopter at the site.  Drilling was finished when the hut arrived so the sling was moved directly to the drill, which was forwarded to G29M.

>     Upon arrival drill was set up for drilling.  Discovered no air coming from compressor.  Compressors Spider Gera was destroyed.  Replaced Spider gear (2 hours) and started drilling (0135 UTC).  At 0209 UTC the compressor over heated.  Ambient air temp approx. 80 degrees.  The compressor over heated 2 more time in a 45 minute period.  The Spider Gear over heated and melted the spider gear.  Day 2.  Upon arrival spider gear was found to be completely melted and required removal of air compressor to scrap out the melted material.  29 minutes of more drilling the back up spider gear disintegrated.  Pipe was deep enough to cut casing and remove hammer as there were no more spider gears.  Day 1 Bear spotted near site.  No Issues.

> Grouting Method: 
>  The grout pipe was screwed into the steel disc and secured in place with the grout pipe clamp on the casing rim. We had difficulty injecting all grout down the pipe- not sure if this is due to the rubber flapper valve being too tight or grout being too viscous. A rigid plug of grout formed in the pipe just above the disc. A second batch was mixed thinner, and pumped in, but we had similar high pressure/low volume injection. When the pipe was removed a portion of grout drained into the bottom. A long pipe with narrow poker was used to probe the flapper to ensure that all remaining void space beneath the disc filled with grout. The result is that the space is not pressurized. Grout was poured down the annulus to the surface.

Potential noise indicators: approximately 15 feet from slope, 1/8 mile from dirt road, 2 miles from Alaska Pipeline, located on a South facing slope. Left with GCI modem problems, the source of the problem appears to be an issue internally to GCI. Remote access has been established from the office on 4/14/2016.

> Comments: We had 25-35 knot winds today, which made slinging loads to the site longer than normal. During drilling the drill rig stopped running, but after cleaning out the air filter the engine started and continued to run without any further issues today. Disengaging the ring bit took longer than normal today due to what we assumed was silt buildup between the ring bit and the hammer.

> Notes:  The station sits on top of a granitic bedrock mountain above the Jennings River valley.  The location is ~225' from the location from the reconnaissance report and permit.  The original location was on slanting bedrock which is very difficult for the Darkside Giraffe drill.  There is no integral leveling ability on the mast, so the rig has to be jacked on to stones or wood, but would migrate off during the vibration of drilling. The borehole took 4 hours drilling in hard bedrock from virtually the surface to total depth.  The team cut off 13.5" of the original casing once it was determined the further attempts at drilling may cause the rig and compressor to be stuck at the station as the weather was deteriorating throughout the day.  Grout was pumped to high pressure and additionally dumped down from the outer annulus.  There is little soil at the station location so the well cap has a wind wall built around the cap and casing.  The hut is anchored with stakes on the hut flange.

> Notes:  The station sits on top of a igneous bedrock ridge in a group of ridges and peaks.  The location is ~768' from the location from the reconnaissance report and permit, but on the same ridge and within eyesight of the original location.  The original location was not large or flat enough for the Darkside Giraffe drill, compressor, and hut.  The wind protector is rocks with vegetated sod adjacent to the casing and well cap.  Solar charging may be problematic in the fall and winter with a series of higher peaks and ridges directly south.

> Notes:
>   The formation was one of those odd rock types that shatters under the hammer into highly angular medium sized gravel. It frequently jams up in the annulus, squelches air flow, and stalls hammer rotation. Jeff had to finesse the hammer carefully for most of the hole; once he got the extension on he found a groove and had little trouble for the remainder.
>  Again Jeff noted that the compressor was reaching high temperatures, so he took a short 15 minute break.

> Comments: 
> J. Miner, J. Folmar and NPS Compliance Archaeologist Lee Reininghaus were flown in to scout the site for NPS approval.  The Lundrill V1 was flown to the site using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The compressor was brought in on the second load. The hut was brought in on the third lift load from Nabesna.  The compressor failed to start at the site and appeared to be an electrical issue.  Trouble shooting was performed and the battery needed to be jumpered with an additional 12 volt power supply to initiate starting the external Vanair compressor.  Near the end of hammering when trying to remove the ring bit and clear cuttings the hammer head assembly failed internally.  The main shaft sheared and the bearing assembly fell out of the hammer.  No bearing fell into the boring.  The field crew was therefore not able to remove the hammer from the ring bit using the hydraulics.  A large pipe wrench was secured to the hammer and 3 field team members rotated the hammer assembly off of the ring bit and were able to manually extract the hammer.  Grouting went well with ~ 20 lbs of grout being pumped around the casing.  Spillage from the inside the pipe covered the grout plate.

A small quantity of water splashed into the casing while washing out the grout pump, the residual was sponged out the following morning.

Top layer was sandy clay with heavy organic content that graded to clayey sand with less organics and some rocks.  Hit a couple of layers with more rocks, as soil graded into clayey sand, but most of the drilling went moderately fast. Bottom half of borehole was wet, sandy clay down to a layer of coarse gravel and cobbles that we could not penetrate.

> Comments: 
> The site is a sited on state land at the head of the Joseph Creek watershed.  The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from Delta Junction via helicopter sling load and then on to I26K once the site was installed.  The hut is south of the casing.   Well-cap was surrounded with a rock windwall and completely buried in sod as was the conduit.
> During drilling the ring bit on the hammer became jammed on the hammer head and would not release.  After extensive efforts the ring bit and casing were removed and then the casing was pushed back in to the borehole to the total desired depth for installation.  Site installation occurred the following day.

> Comments: Compressors both had completely drained batteries and could not be started when they arrived on site.  Determined that since the keys were left in the ignition switch they had rattled to the on position during flight.  For future deployments we should retrofit these with a kill switch, or remove the keys prior to flight. 
>
> We also had significant difficulty dropping the ring bit from the hammer.  On inspection back in Anchorage it was determined that the pilot bit was extremely worn and was therefore deforming the ring bit causing it to wedge on the hammer.  One possible cause of the failure is inadequate downpressure while drilling, drillers should be instructed to use additional downpressure while drilling to prevent future premature failure of the pilot bit.

The team intended to auger a deeper hole but were unable to with the compromised auger bit and had refusal at TD.

> Notes:  The station sits on a nunatak at the confluence of the Dusty and Lowell Glaciers.  High wind exposure is expected at the station as a previous snow guage up slope had blown over and a wind gauge on a rohn tower had been destroyed by the conditions as well.  The borehole went in very easily in the fractured and platy bedrock.  The weather improved throughout the day at the station, but worsened toward Haines Junction.  The Darkside Drilling crew left the station once the borehole was grouted in place.  The hut is anchored with four 2' stakes on the hut flange.

Just as a precautionary measure we put 2.5 inches of grout on top of the plug to be sure that there was a proper seal in the hole. If there is ever a power issue on site here are the locations of the power panels that control the power flow to the site. The main panel is just inside the door of the down stairs apartment and the sub panel is in the same apartment in the bathroom.

> Notes: We found some water where we were not expecting it. Once the grout plug was installed and grouted we had a slight re-charge of the hole. In the end we had 5.5" of water in the hole. We put dry grout in the hole and let it dry until the Install Crew were able to get onsite two days later, which was 6" deep at that time. They bailed until there was 3" of water in the casing. They added enough dry grout to soak up the water and compacted it with sand to create a solid base.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through sand with few gravels and into soft bedrock.   Dozens of blow down, burned out trees had to be moved to make for a level drilling surface.  Additional poles were collected to make a stable and level platform for the station hut.  Additional vegetation clearing for solar and communications was completed as well.  At the completion of drilling the ring-bit had a hard time dropping, taking roughly 15 minutes.  This was caused by the heavy wear on the hammer head allowing the ring bit to over-rotate onto the hammer head and seize.  Additionally, the wear on the head has the ring bit guides almost worn flush, which would allow the ring bit to slide off with the casing any time any upward force was applied.  The ring bit was eventually dropped and the borehole had 2 gallons of grout pumped around the casing and beneath the grout plug.

The steel plug popped while casing was weighed down, causing full breach and equilibrium of annulus grout. The hole lost about 21" to final depth of 82".

> At the end of drilling we dropped the ring bit dropped and left the steel casing in the borehole.  The 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve was used to plug the bottom of the casing.  The plate seats in the casing shoe and locks to the side of the shoe with pins to hold it in place while an o-ring provides a positive seal.  Grouted using "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout.  We had considerable difficulty with our normal grouting procedure and ultimately we had to use a completely different approach to grouting this borehole. A description of what we encountered and how we dealt with it is in the Comments section at the end of this report.  At the end of the process we added a little more grout inside the casing to cover the protrusions from the plate/plug.

> Comments: 
> This borehole was drilled with downhole hammer (DTH) tooling, Delrin blocks inserted, and 100 ft of layflat hose connected to the Vanair compressor. Total time required to reach total depth (TD) was 75 min.  This does not include time spent dealing with the problems described below.  The drilling went smoothly, if slowly, on the way down but we encountered a problem at TD when trying to drop the ring bit and pull out of the hole (POOH).  The effects of this problem cascaded into the grouting process and they are described together, below.  The total time between start of drilling and the final trip out of the borehole was 140 min.
>
> As the drill progressed through the cobbles we noticed that we were gradually losing returns of air and cuttings up the casing, as well as up the borehole annulus.  Penetration rate for the last 4 ft of the borehole was very slow, <1”/min, and returns of cuttings were minimal.  When we reached TD, it was apparent that air returns to the surface were nearly completely shut-off.  When lifting the DTH off bottom to clear the hole, the blast of compressed air raised the casing instead of clearing the hole. 
>
> Conclusion, cuttings were tightly packed between the hammer and the casing, and the casing and the borehole wall, completely cutting off the pathways for air and cuttings to reach the surface.
>
> POOH and noted that ring bit stuck was stuck firmly in place with damp clay.  Cleaned clay off and removed ring bit, cleaned bit shoulders, replaced ring bit and ran in hole (RIH) to TD. Still virtually no air returns up casing.  POOH, estimate 3 ft of casing is clogged with cuttings. Lay back rig, removed ring bit and pulled hammer part way out of casing.  Tried to wash out cuttings by rotating hammer inside casing while pouring water in TOC. Still clogged, so pulled casing completely off. Removed Delrin blocks, cleaned clay from hammer and bit, reloaded casing and RIH.  Drilled to TD, dropped ring bit and POOH.  A plug of clayey sediment ~18” long came up behind the bit.  RIH and used air to blow water and cuttings out of hole.  POOH, lay down rig and load on truck.
>
> Proceeded to grout casing by inserting the aluminum plate/plug, seating it in the casing shoe and locking it place.  Mixed grout, pumped some water to clear the check valve and followed it with pumped grout. Pumped ~ 1/2 gallon before refusal.  Held pressure to see if grout would penetrate further but it did not.  Raised pressure with no better result until hopper check-valve (below grout hopper) blew out.  Fixed hopper check valve and checked grout pipe and downhole check-valve for plugging; grout pipe was dry-packed, downhole check-valve was open and holding pressure - air escaped when opened.
>
> Plan B
> Replace plugged group pipe with new pipe and try again.  The pressure rose immediately with little or no apparent penetration.  Holding pressure while looking down the casing we could see water slowly seeping up through the bolts that engage the holding pins.
>
> Plan C
> Remove one shoe-engagement bolt in order to provide a vent for release of water and air when pumping grout downhole.  Punched out ball-check from downhole valve and tried again.  This time, mixed “runny” grout, filled grout pipe with grout to displace air, connected pump and pumped grout; no noticeable change in results.
>
> Conclusion: Damp cuttings with high clay content that had packed around the hammer inside the casing, were also tightly packed between the steel casing and borehole annulus, creating an impermeable seal.  When pumping the sanded grout against this impermeable seal, the pressure went up rapidly causing the grout to dry-pack in the grout pipe with little grout actually making it through the downhole check valve to fill the void below the casing shoe. Nor was it likely that any grout travelled up the borehole annulus.
>
> Plan D
> Loosen the second shoe-engagement bolt and pull plate/plug out of hole using the grout pipe screwed into the downhole check valve.  Mix extra thick grout and pour it directly into the bottom of the borehole to ensure that the bottom was filled with grout, displacing all air and water. Replaced the plate/plug, tamped it into position and locked it in place.  Added a little more grout atop the plate/plug, enough to covert the tops of the bolts.  Cleaned inside of steel casing with damp wiper, installed box-type cap and left site.
>
> Recommendations:
> 1. Only use pure Portland cement for grouting in the future.  Don’t use sanded grout.  
> 2. Add accelerant if grouting in permafrost or frozen rock. Most “rapid set” formulations include sand and so should be avoided.
> 3. Get a piston-type grout pump that will enable us to displace cuttings packed in the casing-borehole annulus. ChemGrout CG050M is a good possibility

> Comments: 
> The station is located adjacent to the west side of the crew quarters and kitchen on the Klondike DOT yard.  The borehole is approximately 50 inches from the building.  The DOT supervisor did not like the earlier proposed locations due to utilities and planned construction of additional sleeping quarters in the area.  The new borehole was selected with the site supervisor after he cleared the location for utilities.  The borehole was drilled with a cased downhole hammer, as the unconsolidated gravels below the current frost line were collapsing and could not be augered and the borehole remain open.  The borehole is north-west of the station enclosure.

> Notes: We tried to auger the first hole on site but due to the clay layer at approximately 5 feet that kept collapsing we decided to hammer the hole. We drilled down to depth and had issues dropping the ring bit so the casing was pulled and dropped again without the ring bit. After setting the grout plug we left the site and came back the next day to see if we were getting any water charge. We found 12 inches of recharge. Need to re-visit the site later with a different grout plug method.

> The hole was very wet and messy, although there was virtually no groundwater recharge in the bottom once the rig was flown off. Grout plug seated great in spite of muddy conditions. ~7 gallons of cement was pumped down hole with little resistance or evidence of pressure buildup. Unfortunately the groundwater head likely prevented a lot of the pressure from the added cement to dissipate into the formation. Since we had a very limited amount of time on site, the grout pipe had to be loosened, at which time the grout plug popped and the bottom filled with ~18" of cement. The plug was reseated using a ratchet strap and all the cement was bailed out. An extra 0.5 L of sand was poured onto the grout plug.

> Notes: This borehole was augered with the red drill.  Augering quickly encountered seasonally frozen soil but after augering for approximately an hour we were through into unfrozen soils, reaching permafrost in the last 12" of the borehole.  There was a bit of material that sloughed into the borehole while placing the PVC casing.   We flew in on a Ryan Air charter that waited for us with a required departure time.  The Grizzly cooler is not anchored and we were unable to install the soil temperature sensors due to extreme time constraints and weather.

The pipe was well set and tight in the formation, and grout pumped at high pressure into the formation. However, when Bob Pierce stood on the casing cover later, the pipe dropped downward an inch and grout squirted up through the flapped valve. Grout pumped/poured to surface along outer annulus.

> At the end of drilling the ring bit was dropped and steel casing left in the borehole.  The 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve was used to plug the bottom of the casing.  The plate seats in the casing shoe and locks to the side of the shoe with pins to hold it in place while an o-ring provides a positive seal.  Grouted using "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout. We pumped about 1 gal of grout into the borehole before refusal.  The likely cause was fine grained cuttings that packed around the casing during drilling.  When we pulled out the grout pipe the grout remaining inside was allowed to fill the bottom of the casing and cover the protrusions on the top of the plate. The remaining grout was poured around the borehole at the surface.

> Comments: This site is located about 50 miles east of Delta, north of the Richardson Hwy., and was accessed by helicopter.  After a weather check, the helicopter was mobilized from Fairbanks to Delta.  The helicopter had a basket on one side that we loaded with survival kits, rifles, extra clothing and miscellaneous tools.  The construction crew then flew to the site while the ground crew drove the flatbed to a location some 50 miles east on the Richardson Hwy.  After dropping off the crew, the helicopter picked up the drill, with DTH and steel casing, at the roadside location just off the Richardson Hwy (~20 mi away), and slung it to the site.  When that was delivered, the crew worked to setup and level the drill while the helicopter went to get the rest of the gear.  A second sling load brought the compressor, 200 ft of lay flat hose, cement, water, tools and other items in a cargo net.  After the second sling load, the pilot shut down, had lunch and waited while we finished drilling. 
>
> Once we started drilling, progress was steady and there no notable events.  It took about 70 min to drill the borehole. When we were finished drilling, the helicopter picked up the drill and slung it back to the flatbed.  We grouted the steel casing in place and then loaded the cargo net with the compressor and the rest of the gear. The helicopter picked it up on the sling line and flew it back to the flatbed; returned and picked up the crew and flew us back to Delta.  This was our first helicopter access site and it was a completely successful construction effort. The advance planning, written procedures and checklists that we used were instrumental to this success.

> This site construction and installation was a collaboration between TA and AEC. The power and communications are provided by existing AEC infrastructure. An attempt was made to drill a second borehole for a PBO GPS monument. However, the only option was augering and the glacial till was too compact and cobbly for this to succeed. A future attempt to install a GPS monument is under consideration.

> Notes:  Drilling was complicated by multiple systems failures on the drill rig during drilling.  Most significant was failure of the chain that raises and lowers the hammer and rotation head.  We also had significant difficulty dropping the ring bit due to the fact that the hammer joints had become loose.  Ultimately we had to use the helicopter to remove the hammer from the borehole and had to stop drilling short of target depth due to concern that we would lose the tooling downhole if we drilled to 3m.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered through soil and increasing gravels to heavily weathered/fractured rock.  Rain and wind were present for the entire construction activities and the drill rig remains on the site due to A-star mechanical issues.  Approximately 6 gallons of water were poured through the hammer and into the inner annulus of the casing to clear cuttings that were bridging in the soils adhered to the casing wall.  After reaching total depth releasing the ring bit was difficult as a result of the fine grained soils still packed in the ring bit.  More water was used to loosen the soil.   After dropping the ring bit the compressor was left running to dry out some of the remaining water.  Approximately 1 gallon remained at the bottom of the borehole in highly porous rock.  Grout was pumped until refusal and a slight breach of the grout plug o-ring.  A small amount of grout came up around the o-ring, but not enough to cover the plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug.

> At the end of drilling we pulled the ring bit and steel casing out of the borehole. Picked up the drill rig with the helicopter and returned it to the airport.  Screwed together two 5 ft pieces of 6 in schedule 40 PVC, a bottom cap with grout through plug, attached the 3/4” grout pipe, and inserted this assembly into the open borehole.  Mixed and pumped grout (pure portland cement) through the rout pipe -> downhole plug and into the borehole annulus with no major issues.  There was a minimal amount of leakage inside the casing, of indeterminate origin, but not enough to even cover the cap.  Pumped grout until it appeared at the surface, then removed the grout pipe and let its contents empty inside the casing, covering the bottom cap with a couple inches of grout. In total, about 0.5 cu ft of cement was pumped downhole.

> We used an AStar B2 helicopter to sling the drill and a cargo net with the compressor, tools and other supplies to the site. This was a new autonomous station so we also slung a hut with solar panels and a full complement of batteries; in total, 4 sling loads.  The borehole was drilled with downhole hammer tooling, leaving open the channels through the bit face (no Delrin blocks), and using 200 ft of layflat hose connected to the Vanair compressor. 
>
> It took two attempts to make a suitable borehole at this site.  The first attempt failed because we could not adequately anchor the drill in the broken rocks near the surface.  After some time struggling with multiple anchoring attempts, the bucking rig, a crooked hole and getting the casing stuck and then freed, we decided to move the rig and start over.  We moved the drill rig approximately 5 ft forward to where we could place rock bolts as anchors.  After the relocation, the drilling went smoothly to TD.  Drilling time required to reach total depth was ~90 min.

While pulling the hammer out of the casing after dropping the ring bit we jacked the casing out of the ground a few inches. As a result I took local gravel material and dropped it into the bottom of the borehole to fill the void, approximately 2 inches. During grouting we were able to attain sufficient pressure with the grout pump to make me confident that we filled the void to create a solid foundation for the sensor to sit on.

> Notes: This site was challenging due to the hard but brittle nature of the cobble sized basalt/soil matrix we were drilling in. We had six separate holes we attempted to drill with both the hammer and the auger. The hammer was able to drill until small sharp basalt pieces would become lodged between the casing and the hammer, in turn preventing the hammer to spin freely of the casing. The resulting method that proved to work best was to drill until the casing was full of material and then pull the casing from the hole to clear the hole and hammer of loose material. This method resulted in voids around the casing and necessary for us to grout around the pipe.

The Met station includes a wind / noise generator, a Rutland 900 Series Furlomatic.  We found a detached blade from previous Furlomatic about 100M further southwest of the TA station, or 150M from the installed location.  The site has an occasionally used gravel quarry nearer to the Dempster and also across the Dempster.

> Notes: Location was M15K-2, alternate permitted location.  Primary was saturated to the surface with water and their was concern about the rig not being stability on the soft and saturated terrain.  The new location was into bedrock.  Drilling was challenging at this site due to the nature of the rock.  The rock was highly friable and would pack the casing more rabidly than the cuttings could clear, regardless of the speed of drilling.  Patient drilling allowed the boring to get to full depth.  ~2 gallons were pumped through the grout plate and 2.5 gallons pumped through around the outer diameter of the well casing from the surface.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered through platy, fractured rock with soil to bedrock.  Early in the drilling the casing was packing with soil and cuttings.   Several blue drill rig "overheats" occurred, delaying the completion of drilling.  Once into competent bedrock, the rock was hard and the drilling slowed.  The threaded nipple from the grout pipe came unthreaded in the grout plug and remained in the borehole.  An additional liter of sand was added to adequately cover the threaded nipple.   The battery on the blue drill is not getting charged during operation.  Unsure at this point whether it is a failed battery only, or also a failing alternator.

The drilling took 39 minutes to complete.  2 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  This station is located on a small hill with clear sky view and only environmental noise sources.  Wildlife may be a problem with a grizzly bear visiting the site while the installation team was completing the station.

> At the end of drilling the ring bit was dropped and steel casing left in the borehole.  A new prototype steel plate/plug with grout-through valve was used to plug the bottom of the casing.  We had a bit of trouble getting the plate/plug to latch onto the bottom of the casing but solve it by grinding the points of the latch "fingers" to a thinner aspect so they could be turned to latch as designed.  Grouted using "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout. We were only able to pump about 3/4 gal into the borehole before refusal.  The likely cause was fine grained cuttings that packed around the casing during drilling, and our diaphragm pump could not generate enough pressure to penetrate these cuttings.  Also placed some grout inside the casing; enough to cover the protrusions from the plate/plug.

At the start, there was a problem with the oiler for the air hose being plugged but this was resolved by pouring heavy oil (i.e. bar and chain oil) directly into the swivel hose (~3 oz) and into the lay flat hose (~ 4oz) connected to the compressor. Drilling took about 25 minutes in total.  As we removed the drill pipe from the borehole the Delrin blocks fell out and stayed in the bottom of the borehole.

> Comments:
> The station is located off of the Aishihik Lake Rd, approximately 66 miles (106 km) north o the Alaska Highway at Otter Falls.  The road to the site was very rough in parts and may not be passable later in the season as road washout is common and evidence of it beginning were seen.  Created a boulder barrier in front of the hut and the well cap box to discourage disturbance by the very occasional passing traffic.

We were luckily able to drop the ring bit despite the cemented ash.   The borehole swallowed a lot of grout but pumped to resistance.

> Notes: This was a challenging site. We drilled our first hole to a depth of 58" below the surface and pulled the casing to find there was wear on the carbide teeth on the hammer. We had to leave the site due to weather and came back a few days later. To prevent further wear and tear on the hammer we decided to move the drill rig. After drilling 16 inches we pulled the casing and found the same wear on the new ring bit we were using. After some consultation we moved back to our original hole and cleared out the excess material and water that had accumulated, and cut the casing 6.5" above the ground.

> Notes:  Purple drill worked rather well for its first Alaskan outing. We didn't have any issues while drilling. The bore hole was pretty wet so we did have some water and residual material in the borehole. I attempted to clear material with a field made tool and lost it in the borehole. Attempts were made to retrieve the tool but were unsuccessful. The tool was below the ring bit and it was decided that it would not effect any signal since it would be encased in grout.

> Comments: 
> The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The hut was brought in on the second lift load.  Drilling initially was problematic.  After ~3 hours of drilling the crew tripped out the casing and hammer from 1.5 feet down.  Removed the casing and found the hammer was packed with fine, hard packed mud (most likely from the the previous install at O19K).  Hammer was cleaned, and a new borehole was started.  Hammer was steadily advancing until the fuel ran out at the TD reported.  Hut panels oriented 178º.

> Comments: 
> The site is located north of the Braeburn lodge adjacent to the meteorological monitoring station.  The borehole was initially attempted using first a 6" solid stem auger, then an 8" hollow stem auger.  Large cobbles and eventually boulders were encountered in several attempts.  Augering at this site was not feasible. The hammer was mobilized to the site to complete the boring to the reported depth.  The small gravels in the substrate were very problematic for the hammer as well.  They were small enough to get blown into the casing but too large to clear the space between the casing and the hammer.  The hammer had to be removed from the borehole multiple times to remove the casing, empty the gravel and start hammering again.

While pulling the casing out to physically remove the ring bit the bolt that holds the drill mast to the rest of the drill rig broke. We had to wait a few hours for a welder to be slung to the site so we could temporarily fix the red drill rig and finish O17K.

> Notes:  The blue drill shut off for unknown reasons today, we assume bad fuel from Deadhorse, but after a few minutes we were able to get it up and running again. While pulling the hammer from the borehole we jacked the casing 2.5 inches from its original position before we dropped the ring bit. We decided to leave the grout plug in place with the grout pipe secured to the casing over night so that the grout would have enough time to set. We were afraid that the plug would unset itself due to the tricky nature of permafrost.

We were able to run the drill longer but the compressor was not shutting down until 325 degrees F, and according to the manufacturer the shutdown temperature should be 285 degrees F. Further troubleshooting will be done. We were able to attain the compressors temperature by using a temperature gun that was borrowed from Alpine Air's helicopter mechanic.

PVC casing was forced down into the open borehole and 5 gallons of portland grout was poured in around the casing.  The casing was secured with the PVC pipe clamp and staked down while the grout was allowed to set and/or the soil and grout refroze.  Constructed location is ~30' southeast of the location listed on the permit to better ground.

When the rig was operating the drilling progressed quickly.  Approximately 1.5 gallons of grout filled the void beneath the grout plug and around the casing in the bed rock.  The hut was added on 06/18/2017.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth primarily through cobbles and fine grained material.  The drilling took 30 minutes to complete and the ring bit dropped without trouble.  2 gallons of grout were pumped into the borehole, with roughly 1" spilling from the grout pipe on top of the aluminum grout plug.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  Several burned trees (standing dead) were pushed over or cut down to create a safe LZ for the helicopters.

>  The grout pipe was screwed into the steel disc and secured in place with the grout pipe clamp on the casing rim. We had difficulty injecting all grout down the pipe- not sure if this is due to the rubber flapper valve being too tight or grout being too viscous. A rigid plug of grout formed in the pipe just above the disc. A second batch was mixed thinner, and pumped in, but we had similar high pressure/low volume injection. When the pipe was removed a portion of grout drained into the bottom. A long pipe with narrow poker was used to probe the flapper to ensure that all remaining void space beneath the disc filled with grout. The result is that the space is not pressurized. Grout was poured down the annulus to the surface.

> Grouting Method: Mixed ~4gal of pure portland cement at the surface and then dumped it into the borehole, ~1x94lb bag portland cement.  Assembled 4 sections of 6in ID PVC casing, with plug installed in bottom piece. Pushed PVC casing into borehole and displaced cement to the bottom of the hole; had to overcome hydrostatic pressure to get the casing down. Wrapped plastic around the top 4 ft of casing in the ground. Put temporary cap on PVC, set anchors and tie-down wires to keep the PVC in place.  Left PVC cap and tie-down wires in place while cement cured.

> Comments: 
> The site is a joint site with PBO.  The Lundrill V1 was flown to the site from Homer airport via helicopter sling load.  The hut is north of the casing. This location can experience extensive drifting from winter storm events.  The casing topper was completely buried in site rocks to minimize the impact.  The well casing cap was not at the site upon arrival.  All other equipment had been left during the June attempted construct/install.  The field crew modified a small cooler (12"x12"x16") by cutting a hole in the base slightly smaller than the casing OD and placing a bulkhead fitting on one of the walls.  The cooler was slid over the casing and silicone sealant was added internally and externally at the penetration site.  After the sensor was bedded, the cooler lead was sealed with additional silicone and the ratchet strap was used to secure the lid in place. The entire cooler, bulkhead fitting and conduit was then fully buried in site rocks.

> Notes:  The station is located on a subordinate hill surrounded by larger mountains on all sides.  Directly to the south is a large mountain which will shadow the station for the majority of the year.  The hut was rotated SE to take advantage of the "best" sky view for solar charging.  This station may need additional power storage to successfully over winter without power loss.

> The station is located at the CBC tower and near the GPS site ATLI.  Drilling went well from the surface in competent rock.  Unable to complete standard construction as a kiosk to be used also by the GPS station has yet to be installed.  Planned completion of construction at a later date.  The cable run from the borehole to the kiosk is quite long and is over a combination of duff, soil, and bedrock.  Burying the conduit may be problematic.  Comms also need to finalized with the DSL provider in Atlin.

> Notes: The borehole was hammered to total depth through soil with gravels and into competent rock.   The drilling took 57 minutes to complete, with a break in the middle to acquire the hammer extension.  3.5 gallons of grout were pumped to refusal.  Due to water running from the near surface, down the casing, 1" of dry grout was added to the top of the grout plate.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug/grout and leveled.  The station is located on a small bedrock knob SE of the ski hill garage.  The station is near the base of Mt Eyak and overlooks Cordova.

> Comments: 
> J. Miner, J. Folmar and NPS Compliance Archaeologist Lee Reininghaus were flown in to scout the site for NPS approval.  The Lundrill V1 was flown to the site using the A-star and positioned in place by the field crew.  The compressor was brought in on the second load. The hut was brought in on the third lift load from Nabesna.  The compressor failed to start at the site and appeared to be an electrical issue.  Trouble shooting was performed and the battery needed to be jumpered with an additional 12 volt power supply to initiate starting the external Vanair compressor.  Near the end of hammering when trying to remove the ring bit and clear cuttings the hammer head assembly failed internally.  The main shaft sheared and the bearing assembly fell out of the hammer.  No bearing fell into the boring.  The field crew was therefore not able to remove the hammer from the ring bit using the hydraulics.  A large pipe wrench was secured to the hammer and 3 field team members rotated the hammer assembly off of the ring bit and were able to manually extract the hammer.  Grouting went well with ~ 20 lbs of grout being pumped around the casing.  Spillage from the inside the pipe covered the grout plate.

Turned metal screw from surface to compress rubber seal between two-piece plastic sandwich.  Check valve in plug (sticks up ~ 1in) to keep cement on outside of PVC. Pumped about 2 gallons of cement downhole until refusal; ~0.5, 94lb bags.  We did not attempt to put additional grout down the brehole annulus because there was hardly any annular space. Placed 3in of cement on top of the plug to cover up the plastic check valve and steel bolt.  Left compression rod and grouting pipe in place while cement cured.

> Comments: Had some problems with the hydraulic system on the drill, starting on the previous day. We solved the problem and started drilling around 12:00.  We also drilled a hole at this location for the PV post.  While drilling the hole for the PV post, the gravely slate layers that we passed through were collapsing around the casing and wedging it so tightly that it was increasingly difficult to pull the drill string back up and out of the hole.  We decided to stop drilling this hole at 36in to ensure that we did not get the casing stuck.  Pulled the drill string out of borehole with some difficulty.

> The site is a sited on state land at the head of the Joseph Creek watershed.  The Lundrill V2 was flown to the site from Delta Junction via helicopter sling load and then on to I26K once the site was installed.  The hut is south of the casing.   Well-cap was surrounded with a rock windwall and completely buried in sod as was the conduit.
> During drilling the ring bit on the hammer became jammed on the hammer head and would not release.  After extensive efforts the ring bit and casing were removed and then the casing was pushed back in to the borehole to the total desired depth for installation.  Site installation occurred the following day.

It was solidly set on the 2nd day. The top of the pipe is capped. A set of heavy duty straps were strung between the PV mount to the Grizzly cooler to help prevent rotation of the pipe.

> Comments: Drilling was difficult due to small cobbles jamming up the casing. At 2340 UTC we took off the first casing due to dents and replaced it with a new one. We also replaced the ring bit for good measure in the hopes that it would help expedite drilling. 0000 UTC we abandoned our borehole and moved the drill rig over approximately three feet to begin a new borehole. After moving the drill we were able to complete drilling by 0241 UTC.

Once the drilling was complete and the grout plug was in place there was enough pressure to push a small amount of water through the center rubber gasket. When the Install team returned the next day the water had frozen.

> Notes: Drilling was interrupted by drill shutdowns, but we were able to persevere. While pulling the hammer out of the casing after dropping the ring bit we jacked the casing out of the ground a few inches. As a result I took local gravel material and dropped it into the bottom of the borehole to fill the void, approximately 2 inches. During grouting we were able to attain sufficient pressure with the grout pump to make me confident that we filled the void to create a solid foundation for the sensor to sit on.

> Notes:  Drilling the hole went well. Grouting the hole was a different story. There was enough water recharge happening that when the grout plug was installed the casing would flood. We attempted to set the grout plug three times. On the third attempt we poured 1/4 gallon of dry grout into the casing before installing the grout plug. We installed the grout plug and pumped approximately a gallon of grout through the grout plug. After we pumped  the grout we poured approximately 1/4 gallon of dry grout onto the grout plug and left the site for the night. The next morning when we came back to the site there was approximately 32.5 inches of water on top of the grout plug. It was decided that we would come back to the site at a later date once a solution was found for overcoming the water recharging.

> Notes: This borehole was hammered to depth through granite.   Drilling progressed relatively quickly, completing the hole in 38 minutes.  The wind wall and conduit burial was with rocks from the site.  No additional site clearing was necessary.  Grout was pumped until increased back pressure caused the grout pipe to deflect slightly.  Approximately 2.5 gallons of grout filled the void beneath the grout plug and around the casing in the bed rock.

No jacking was observed.  3 liters of sand were added on top of the grout plug and leveled.  68 minutes total drilling today.  The station was relocated within the same Township/Section/Range of the State of Alaska permit for better southern exposure and a better BGAN look angle.

> Drilling Log:
> 0 - 5 ft  Fill - 3/4” gravel and sandy soil with light organics near the surface

> Casing Material: Steel
> Casing Base:  Aluminum plate/plug with grout-through valve covered by grout.
> Rim to Bottom of casing: 103.25
> Rim to grade level: 6.5 in

> Grouting Method: 
> At the end of drilling the ring bit was dropped and steel casing left in the borehole.  The 2nd generation aluminum plate with o-ring seal and grout-through valve was used to plug the bottom of the casing.  The plate seats in the casing shoe and locks to the side of the shoe with pins to hold it in place while an o-ring provides a positive seal.  Grouted using "Cement All" non-shrink rapid-set grout. We started pumping rout but the hole would not take any and back pressure blew out the check-valve below the funnel.  We took apart the hoses and pipes and determined that the blockage was in the downhole check valve.  When in with a tool to clear the blockage, reassembled pipes and hoses and resumed grouting. We pumped about 3/4 gal of grout into the borehole before refusal. When we pulled out the grout pipe the grout remaining inside was allowed to fill the bottom of the casing and cover the protrusions on the top of the plate. The remaining grout was poured into the borehole at the surface.

> Comments: 
> We started drilling this borehole with the auger but hit large rocks and cobbles at about 6 ft bgl and decided to switch to the downhole hammer.  We ran the hammer without Delrin blocks, using only 100 ft of air hose and it performed well to total depth. It took a total of 75 minutes to drill the borehole, including 40 minutes to swap the tooling.
